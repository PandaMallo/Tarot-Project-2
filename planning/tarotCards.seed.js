    name: 'The Fool',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'innocence, new beginnings, free spirit',

    reverseKeywords: 'recklessness, being taken advantage of, inconsideration',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Fool appears in the upright position when you are about to enter a new stage in your life. An unexpected opportunity can arise when you are not expecting, or you can be called to make important decisions and it will take you on a new path.

This new beginning can lead anywhere, and you may need to follow the course of events. The new relationship is probably about to start, or another person may appear in your life. The people that you meet in the present may later be participants in the new cycle of your career advancement or personal development. The Fool can also denote a bisexual or gay person who will affect the situation.

This card demonstrates the need to take risks with childhood optimism and carefree. Because incredible views can provide a way to solve a problem, you need to maintain openness to new ideas. The Fool can signify a period marked by stress, lack of clarity, and uncertain conditions. Sudden development can leave you defenseless and give you some anxiety until you regain your demeanor.

At this point, you have a very special ability. You should wisely leave the past and start something new. It may be wrong to stick to traditional and outdated methods because the subconscious mind is guiding you to start a new life. Sometimes the Fool shows a commitment to a real journey, especially if other travel cards appear in the deck (such as Chariot, Wheel of Fortune, the World, Six of Swords, Eight of Wands, or Knight of Wands).`,

    reverseFullDescription: `In reversed meaning, the Fool warns of taking risks if you have not carefully considered the situation yet. You may feel like standing at the edge of a cliff and ready to fall. You may be fooled by your point. Remember Emerson’s statement that silly preservation is the specter of wisdom. The present situation makes you fear the unknown or something that the future can bring.

Avoid over-optimism and blurred vision for risky jobs. An impulsive decision or a lack of wise betting will hurt you. Unexpected problems can occur. You may be in a precarious situation caused by yourself or by someone’s foolish behavior. Your valuation may be wrong, or you may not receive valuable advice.

You must try to keep your point. Someone next to you will probably have a foolish decision. You, by yourself, may not have enough prudence to ensure your future’s happiness. Someone may not be as loyal as you think he/she is. Your partner or your friends may not be consistent with the relationship. Remember that the infatuation is different from love.`,

    name: 'The Magician',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'willpower, desire, creation, manifestation',

    reverseKeywords: 'trickery, illusions, out of touch',

    uprightFullDescription: `You are about to take advantage of the expertise you gain from the hard work. You, or someone you trust, can use special skills and talents to achieve goals. This is the right time to run the project because you are the one that masters your destiny. All necessary facilities are available in your hands. Technology master of modern equipment will assist you.

You can control new situations, act positively, and focus on recognizing your potential. You can promote yourself to those who are interested in using your special skills and knowledge. Creative imagination will be beneficial at this time as well as intensive training or education.

Your organizational skills are in your hands. For those questions about money, it is possible to be financially successful. The Magician in the upright shows you have a way to use your natural powers to reach your goal. Special skills and technical expertise may be needed to achieve success. It urges you to observe, experiment, continue to adapt, refine your skills, and learn to control your life. On the topic of health, it can manifest to the physician or surgeon skilled.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `For some reasons, you do not use your abilities and talents to set goals.
Indecision can cause difficulties or delays. Maybe you do not know enough to finish the job and need more training to improve skills. You may be pretending to know more about something. The lack of confidence can cause you to miss out on important opportunities, or maybe too much self-confidence that turns you into unrealistic plots. Someone may impede your efforts or cover your eyes. After all, this card is a juggler. Sometimes, the reverse of it refers to relatives that always bother you

If you are asking about a relationship, the card indicates that you may feel depressed about sex. Instead, you can have sex with someone who is good at sex but does not appreciate long-term emotional aspects of a relationship. Check your own behavior to see if you are acting selfishly, less interested in the rights, and the needs of others.

The Magician reversed shows a sense of lack of power. This is the time to apply your diligence to success. You should avoid excess physicalism and selfish interests. You may not be able to connect with your feminine instinct as you focus too much on holding the outside world. This will not be the time to give up a safe job for self-employment.`,

    name: 'The High Priestess',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'intuition, unconscious, inner voice',

    reverseKeywords: 'lack of centre, lost inner voice, repressed feelings',

    uprightFullDescription: `Something is going on quietly. Hidden knowledge needs to be exposed. The High Priestess appears upright when you need to be aware of the deepest feelings and listen to your inner voice. Something in the present situation deeply affects your subconscious. Now it is the time to express, meditate, pray, and connect with your inner self and believe in feelings.

Your dreams and wisdom will give you the best advice. Past conditions and original memory are affecting the present situation. You may have a great interest in mystery, spirituality, psychology, psychoanalysis, or any topic related to the hidden aspects of existence. At the same time, your concern is that sexuality is low.

This card can also imply uncertainty and the changing of your life. Things that were previously considered obvious are no longer guaranteed anymore. A few cryptic mysteries are gradually becoming clearer but they have not been revealed yet at this time. On the positive side, you will notice that your intuitive possibilities are gradually increasing and you can be inspired by creativity. Thus, the High Priestess is a particularly advantageous card for artisans, such as artists or writers.

Reasonable or telepathic women can come to help you. Someone who understands the inner movements of your mind or of your present circumstances can help you. The secret or aspect which are concealed in your situation can be revealed. Generally, this card appears when you need to awaken hidden potential, exploit psychological depths or undiscovered talents to succeed. Sometimes, it can refer to learning through training or intensive education.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `The reversed meaning of this card shows that you are missing the attention to your true needs and emotions. You may be too rational to solve the problem. Someone around you may be too sensitive and emotional in a way that is out of control. You may too concentrate on the mission of life outside to spend enough time for yourself. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something, however, you are not ready to listen.

Though your intuition is urging you, for some reason you have extinguished it and not really listen to what your subconscious mind is trying to convey to you. You have to admit the High Priestess as a center of meditation inside you that has not been exposed to the outside world and believe that she will always be there when you need her.

You do not have much time to connect with her, but she is still an important part of you. Whenever you feel like things are out of control and you are facing impossible choices, find a quiet place and listen to the voices from within your inner being.

If you stop thinking about your problems, or give yourself a little space and “empty” moment in thought, the answer will come to you even if you do not need to think about it. So, you should try listening to your “subconscious” and see what happens to you.

Perhaps you lose connection with emotions and things are implicitly occurring. The hidden knowledge will affect your decision, just make sure you have all the actual data before proceeding. You may feel emotional or need to negotiate with someone who is extremely tense, tired of work. Your intense sexual desire can undermine your judgment. Do not say “yes” when you want to say “no”.
At a deeper level, this reversed card means that you have not been able to accept yourself as a woman. If you are a man, it may imply a negative rejection of accepting your own feminine, emotional, and intuitive aspects.

Finally, the mysterious and positive nature of the High Priestess can be switched to negative when this card appears in reverse, implying that it may be just rumors, hidden facets or problems are happening on the surface. If that is the case, you should offer to know the truth, prevent others from “beating around the bush” and conceal your secrets and other information.`,

    name: 'The Empress',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'motherhood, fertility, nature',

    reverseKeywords: 'dependance, smothering, emptiness',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Empress is a card of luck, showing the creativity, reproduction, sexuality, and fertility of women. It tells you this is the time to express the creative instinct by effective actions. Any art journey will be successful. Your career may be related to beauty, sensitivity, or material satisfaction and your hard work now is rewarded with success on wealth. Many relationships will also make you happy.

This card encourages you to take the time to immerse yourself in nature. On vacation, do not just stay around in hotels in bustling cities, instead, explore nature by camping or hiking. You should give yourself the time and space to go to another state of mind where you can truly connect with Mother Earth and let her reign in your heart and mind. Let’s travel to your favorite natural lands, such as a forest, a sea, mountains or lake and simply sit for a few minutes, a few hours or even a few days to breathe the energy around you while enjoying the beauty of nature.

It also emphasizes that you are connected to the physical aspect (a stable influence), but you can still reach higher levels of consciousness through your connection with nature. You have the potential to connect between Earth and everything.

It can refer to marriage, pregnancy (especially comes with the Three of Cups), or birth. If you are looking for a baby, everything will be good. The fruits of your labor are being formed. Beauty and material satisfaction are likely to appear around you. You can share your feelings and give or receive love.

The Empress also encourages you to connect with others by supporting and taking care of those around you. Let’s find ways to stimulate communication, create an atmosphere to express your feelings for everyone.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `In general, you are feeling impeded and cannot be creative. Your level of material satisfaction may be low, or you’d rather cling to material things that you possess selfishly than share with your loved ones. Greed can create problems in your relationships.

Your condition can be depressed or boring. Money may be lacking and you may feel poor and unable to achieve the desired result. Sexual relationships without love do not bring satisfaction. The Empress reversed sometimes refers to sexual problems or unwanted pregnancies. This post may be a warning to prevent unsafe relationships. It can also refer to problems with pregnancy and the ability to abort. You may find that you do not want to conceive or decide you will not have another baby.

You also maybe keep to yourself too much with someone you love and this is tiring for your relationship. Be aware that you will not become a mother who is full of stifling and strict. Are you caring for your partner, your friends, or your family as if you were their “mother”? Be careful not to exaggerate the character of this card. You may need to follow the example of the High Priestess, who listens to the inner self to find a solution.

In general, the Empress reversed implies that you are feeling dissatisfied because something is missing or missing in your life, or because you want to find something creative, meaningful or satisfying to do but you do not know what it is. This card may represent an obstacle to creativity. You may feel depressed or negative. The work itself seems too heavy and trivial. This is not the time to think, instead act or execute. You are becoming overloaded and mental pursuits will not bring you the things you need. Trying to put more effort according to what your wisdom or thoughtful thinking tells you will only cause frustration or lead you astray.`,

    name: 'The Emperor',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: ' authority, structure, control, fatherhood',

    reverseKeywords: 'tyranny, rigidity, coldness',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Emperor in the upright shows you the ability to use rational thinking and direct action to achieve great success. You can be promoted at work because of excellent organizational skills. However, you may have to deal with competition or with someone who has authority. This is a card of respect, stability, solidity, domination, and reason. It shows that you are becoming the person you have formed in the world.

The reason beyond love is sometimes not expected or even avoided, but for this card, this is necessary and even welcomed. If you are facing difficult choices, you need to maintain your concentration, be decisive and believe in your ability to control yourself and your concentration. Remember that if you can control yourself then you will not have much trouble controlling the world and everything within it.

Now it is the time to act responsibly and to reorganize a structured/ stable environment. Your instructor or helpful companion will assist you. Your status in society can be a problem. The Emperor emphasizes the dominance of relationships that leads to the loss of emotion and affection. In a spread filled with tension, this card warns of overstrain and shows the ability to deal with the rules of society.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `On a personal level, the Emperor reversed may indicate that you lack self-control, ambition, and ability to deal with any kind of power. In fact, you may slightly disregard the kind of rules and discipline. However, you may need to bring more order into your life at this time.

Lately, everything you have done is quite messy and this is when you need to live with rules again.

Something that constrains your evolution at this time. You may be looking at too many problems with reason rather than with the heart. Adherence to rigid principles way too much can break the meaning of the rule. Maybe you are in a situation where you feel incomplete or poor.

You may feel tempted to either escape or run away from your problem. A young boy can cause trouble in your life. The Emperor in reverse may refuse to accept legitimate authority to enjoy reliance as a child or the irresponsible. You need to grow up and stop living in the world of childhood.

There is something outrageous or exaggerated in your behavior. You may be bullying others or acting in a totalitarian way. The current relationship can be marked by domination-submission and master-slave. If you ask about work, you probably will not be promoted at this time.`,

    name: 'The Hierophant',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'tradition, conformity, morality, ethics',

    reverseKeywords: 'rebellion, subversiveness, new approaches',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Hierophant in the upright can refer to the search for spiritual meaning. You should focus on moral development. A wise instructor or a reputable teacher can appear to help you in your spiritual journey. You can attend ceremonies or celebrations that connect with the tradition of a community. Also, you can visit the place of worship or attend the wedding ceremony. Now it is the time to pay attention to common rights.

It can represent any reliable consultant who will give you expert advice. A person who has power can act on your behalf as a mediator in order to achieve what you want. For those questions related to love, this card refers to a very traditional or pure relationship.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `On the optimistic side, the Hierophant reversed may imply that you need to try a non-conventional approach to solve your current problem. The traditional view may not be credible at this time. You may need to break the traditional mold to get out of the way. Dare to be different. To be successful, be pioneering in your thoughts, express yourself, let others and yourself see how you really feel about the problem.

On the negative side, this card may imply that you are too fanatical in your thinking and too dogmatic in the way you look at the problem. Are you applying the positive qualities of this card (traditional view and convention) in the opposite way? Are you dealing with obsessive thinking and being forced into action or are you avoiding facing directly? Are you wearing a mask that conceals your true feelings, not only just to others but also to yourself?

High level of non-compliance is also similar to persistence. Traditional or pre-formulated methods may not bring the results as expected. The advice you get now may not be useful or goes in the wrong direction. Religious or wedding ceremonies are likely to occur. If you want to ask about relationships, marriage is not a wise move at this time.`,

    name: 'The Lovers',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'partnership, union, duality, choice',

    reverseKeywords: 'lost of balance, one-sidedness, disharmony',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Lovers in the upright often appear when you face important life decisions and have to choose the right path to follow. It can foreshadow a romantic journey, often accompanied by experiment or selection. Bonding, physiological adjustment, love, and marriage can take over your mind. You may be concerned with the process of an important relationship. When two of Cups also appear in a spread, you may be in a  significant relationship.

This card warns you to carefully consider every aspect of an important decision before making the final one. By any other ways, you are being challenged before you can move on to the next stage of development. You are at the crossroad. You may fall into a new relationship or an affair. You may need to choose between two potential partners. You may find yourself needing to buy new clothes or need to improve your appearance to attract new ones. Short trips and communication are most likely to occur.

In the Rider-Waite Tarot deck, the Lovers depicts Archangel Raphael, the Protector of Healing, as a background character. It can be a sign of the need for healing, either for the soul or for the body. This is the time it takes to have a sincere conversation about an important relationship with a trusted counselor or friend. In a good spread, this card is a sign of mental protection and recovery.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `You can hurt someone or vice versa. There may be an opportunity to stay together or an invitation was not made and the insiders are wondering about the other’s feelings. Maybe you are in a split situation or the end of love. If you ask about marriage, you may be desperate to find a suitable partner and be afraid to live alone. Concerns about the physiological adjustment can occupy your mind. Maybe you are stuck in an unhealthy relationship. The fear of bondage may be creating problems in your love life.

You must learn to be responsible for your behaviors and choices. Someone around you may protest the decision you made. If you are facing an important decision, seek expert advice and make informed choices to avoid later regrets. Sometimes, the Lovers in reverse signifies the beginning of a health problem.`,

    name: 'The Chariot',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'direction, control, willpower',

    reverseKeywords: 'lack of control, lack of direction, aggression',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Chariot represents the conquest, the victory and the surpassing opponents by your confidence and control. Any success is the result of applying these factors to the situation. You will just use your willpower to overcome all obstacles or challenges on the journey. You can even notice that by enhancing the forces which are hindering you around at this moment, you can take advantage of them to benefit you. You have to be resolute, self-restrained, and industrious. If you are, you will overcome any difficulty or anyone who tries to pull you back. This fight will make you stronger.

It shows the need to occupy central positions and control the competitive forces. You have the ability to calmly dominate, as long as you balance the thoughts, emotions and these desires which contradict each other.

At the same time, you may feel you can not get that result quickly, so the best action is to follow the power that you have set. You may be struggling to prove yourself because you need to handle a series of conflicting interests. You will be able to continue to pursue the plan once you have made that decision. Your tactics should go forward with clear determination and purpose. You have to conquer the difficulty and win.

The Chariot Tarot card requires that you always have assertiveness and daring. You may need to take care of yourself at this point and be confident of expressing your needs and desires, otherwise, you will not be able to finish your journey. You need to have faith in yourself and understand who you basically are and what you have been living for (from which, the building of systems and the value of personal trust will be established through the Lovers tarot card)

In general, no matter what you are asking about any situation, they will deal with the way you want them to be. Your willpower and purpose will make you able to rise to the top. Chariot can literally be a trip, buying a car, or rewarding yourself with a new vehicle.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `The Chariot reversed means that you are feeling as if you have no control over your life. You can lose the power to dominate opposing forces and you are now giving up on the situation. Time after time, you can feel every direction you go is leading to stagnation.

If you are the kind of person who wants to control your destiny and want to know where you are headed, then it is time to revive yourself, live more disciplined and focus on what you are doing. Although the feeling of powerlessness can make you dull, let’s take a look at what you can control and what you can not. Do not allow yourself to worry about things which are out of your control as if you can not do anything. Instead, focus your strength and energy on things within your reach.

Let’s look at what you can do to change the situation. In this step, you need to be able to feel as if you have many different directions because now you are being lured and pushed into the massive world of fate.

You are feeling uncomfortable, unfocused and can not control your fate. You may be separated from the path you have set yourself for a while. You need to solve a situation involving conflicting forces. You feel being pulled in two directions and need to find a solution in between.
Maybe you are taking on too many tasks and can not balance the requirements at the same time. Literally, the Chariot in reverse can be troublesome in traveling or transporting, or the need to repair a car.`,

    name: 'Strength',

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'bravery, compassion, focus, inner strength',

    reverseKeywords: 'self-doubt, weakness, insecurity',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Strength Tarot card in the upright represents a higher level of awareness that allows you to take responsibility for yourself so that you can master yourself and your own world. This card reminds us that within each of us there is a part of empathy and instinct that will manifest itself in a frequent or a rare way, depending on each individual.

If you are one of those types of impulsive or unreasonable people as well as the kind of person who utters angry or negative words to others, it also reminds you to try to tamper yourself. The woman in this card conquers the lion by carrying peace, love, and warmth with her. You will probably need to do the same thing to prevent yourself from jumping on other people and say something that you may regret later.

The quality of this card is inside of you, waiting to come out as soon as you can control all the mundane elements, your basic emotions and when you are ready to perform mental tasks ahead. It speaks of the basic lesson in which emotions need to be overcome if wisdom and intuition are awakened. Sometimes, the inner voice is overwhelmed by temporary emotions, anxieties, and fears.

Only when you get rid of these immature emotions, you can begin to find the peace you need. You have to conquer your fears, control your impatient, impulsive personality, and never lose your patience with yourself or with what you are doing. At the end, you will even see the wisdom of following the inside of you. The Strength card will let you see that you have the power to tame the “animal” part in you. Reflecting on this card can help the process of enhancing and experiencing the power which is inherent in your natural being.

The main point is to spend time meditating and pondering (even if you have a strong relationship and nineteen children anyway)! Do not let yourself sink in fear and anxiety. The world outside will be fine, it is important to keep your mind awake.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `You may feel weak, sick, vulnerable, depressed and hyperactive because of the present situation. This is not the time to push something. The reverse of the Strength card shows the need to accept “the animal part” inside of you. You may be over-reliant on others or may be addicted to stimulants/alcohol to balance your life. In addition, someone may be bullying or harassing you. You need to ensure your inner strength with assurance to feel strong and confident.

You may need to re-evaluate your situation because you are trying to achieve the goal which goes beyond your ability. To do that process, you need to accept sin, self-doubt, and fear. The opposite of the Strength card, literally, is sometimes fatigue, physical weakness, or illness and the need for better health care. Now, you can also get in touch with sick people.`,

    uprightKeywords: 'contemplation, search for truth, inner guidance',

    reverseKeywords: 'loneliness, isolation, lost your way',

    uprightFullDescription: `The Hermit learned to help others with love and compassion. This tarot card signifies that you have crossed the important milestones and now you can understand and appreciate the different paths that people have chosen to target for higher goals. You have reached enough levels to enlighten yourself and do not have to convince others about what they should do.

You can lean on the silence and let the light within your soul shine on others as the means of communication. It is time to voluntarily withdraw from the world to quietly seek the truth. You must merge with the Origin. You need to rest and quietly think about the situation. Meditation, deep thoughts and quiet reflection in order. This is the time to wait patiently and not to communicate with others.

Sometimes, consultation will help you in the process of seeing yourself. You should spend time thinking carefully and be patient when trying to make a cautious decision. Most of the answers are in itself, but if you are feeling stuck, seek good advice from the wiser and the more experienced. This is also a good time to study or research on a topic that interests you.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `You may fall into the situation of doing something your way in which you refuse the good advice of others. The tendency to get rid of others from your life can make you feel lonely and denied. That personality trait can even lead to a breakdown of the relationship. 

If you spend too much time on inner thoughts, the appearance of the Hermit implies that you have been in solitary confinement for so long. You are truly becoming a hermit and isolating yourself from the people around you. Although this period of time will benefit you mentally, you may still feel isolated and suffer from a sense of loneliness. Do not underestimate the value of maintaining communication with others even when you are on your own spiritual journey. You also should consider the needs of those around you. Do not become too dependent on yourself and your difficult situations to forget your family and friends.`,

    uprightImage: '',
    reverseImage: '',

    uprightKeywords: 'change, cycles, inevitable fate',

    reverseKeywords: 'no control, bad luck, clinging to control',

    uprightFullDescription: `You are entering a new cycle related to lucky circumstances, promising positive changes and continuous progress. Fast changes create new opportunities to improve your life. An opportunistic situation may be the key to ending a difficult situation in the past and foreshadowing luck and success.
You may need to make important decisions that will affect the opening of many events in your life. A new chapter in your life is about to start. You are closing one stage and starting another one. Fate is pointing towards your favor. Literally, the card sometimes refers to the new vehicle that will appear in your life.
The Wheel of Fortune implies that you should not just stand still and accept what life offers. You can actively maintain the positive part of this wheel. When things go downhill, instead of waiting and hoping things will get better again, you should actively improve the situation and accelerate the recovery process. Finally, this card implies that you should not let yourself fall into depression when facing adversity.
Adversity is a natural part of life and always exists over time. Actually when bad moments happen, you do not need to worry, instead, accept that and do not necessarily show that you are having problems, find ways to face and overcome those difficulties. If the problem you are experiencing can not be solved, the card can be a hint to the solution for the problem.
The Wheel represents fate and reminds you that “what is coming will come”. The Wheel of Fortune in the upright shows that you may be in a positive state but do not become complacent. You need to behave in the right way to ensure that good luck and positive things always stay with you.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `Circumstance changes suddenly and becomes worse. Hopes and wishes are not fulfilled. Your life seems to have no clear purpose. You are entering the cycle of recession and the period of disappointment before everything gets brighter. This is not a good time to take risks. You need to wait for the new turn of the Wheel. Testing the movement and progress of the planets to gain insights into the current risks may be helpful.
Usually, the reversed meaning of the Wheel of Fortune implies those resources are out of your control, making you feel helpless and powerless. However, the bad times that you are experiencing can also be considered the result of the wrong decisions which you have made in the past. You should think about the actions you took and consider whether they played a role relating to your current situation or not.
What can you do to improve your fortune and take control of your destiny? Despite failures, you can get lessons in life and prepare for many ups and downs which are about to come. You need to take responsibility for the present and the future as well as find ways to bring more positive results.`,

    uprightKeywords: 'cause and effect, clarity, truth',

    reverseKeywords: 'dishonesty, unaccountability, unfairness',

    uprightFullDescription: `Justice Tarot card appears when you need to consider a variety of factors to make an informed decision. This card warns you that you need to think carefully and wisely before making the final decision. It is a card of calmness and balance. You will have to look at your conscience and consider other people’s views well before making a moral choice. The highlight here is the issue of fairness.

This also shows that you are involved in legal proceedings in the near future. Legal issues will proceed in a fair and disinterested way. Justice will eventually win, especially if the upright major Judgment also appears in the spreading. Equitable results can be obtained through the support of an impartial third party. If someone has done something wrong with you, you will soon be able to get an apology. If you have acted unfairly, you will face the consequences.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `
The Justice reversed tells you that what you truly deserve may be delayed. You may fall into a situation where you feel like you have been treated unfairly. Maybe you are the victim of a felony or you have falsely accused others. Someone who is involved in a decision about you may have prejudice. Your overconfidence or lack of certainty may be harming you. You may have to quit your job and make a certain decision to pursue your goals.

An authorized person may be abusing his power. An apology may have been made but not yet ready to be told. Do not go against the law yourself because there is only more injustice. You need to stop being neutral because of the fear of making others sad.

If you are involved in litigation or arbitration, the result may be costly or unprofitable for you (especially if the reversed Six of Wands appears during a spread). If you are considering or in some way, you are judged, the results may not reflect what you really know, perhaps because of some unfair aspect of the situation or perhaps because you are not yet well prepared.`,

    uprightKeywords: 'sacrifice, release, martyrdom',

    reverseKeywords: 'stalling, needless sacrifice, fear of sacrifice',

    uprightFullDescription: `The reversed position of the man in the Hanged Man card reminds you to look at yourself from a completely different perspective. Although the image hanging backward implies that your life is delayed for a while, you will realize what needs to change in yourself. The tree on which he hangs has a lot of leaves and vines, which implies that the tree has the potential to produce more fruit.
Besides, this card shows a reversal in your normal way of life and the observation of the world from a completely different perspective. Perhaps you should try hanging up yourself and looking around as the character of this card. As a result, your view will change completely, although the surroundings will still be the same when you look at the standing position.

This card also requires you to rotate your world and look at your situation in a different way. When you do that, you will find something new that is proven to be more valuable to you at a deeper level. You may have to abandon your beliefs or even your previous way of life. This is a time of renewal, so your life will be able to move forward.

At the moment, let’s take a short break and stop the action. You need to re-evaluate your attitudes, goals, and priorities while maintaining loyalty to your spiritual values. Time seems to drift slowly and you may feel like you are in a state of inactivity. This is the time to experiment and learn a lesson. You are entering a great transformation in which you feel trapped between the old and the new, have the ability to devote yourself wholeheartedly to an important project or great ambition and have unique ideas that others do not understand or appreciate.

Perhaps you have to work hard or sacrifice to achieve more wonderful things. You can join the group of people who sacrifice like the way you do and need to give up the old ones to make way for the new ones. In addition, you can give up selfish desire in love and bondage to others (or even a relationship because you realize it causes the disadvantage). Time spent on contemplation, resting, relaxing, thinking is worth it. You need to reconnect with the spiritual life. It is possible that you are over anxious and need to connect with the higher power. Other people most likely do not understand your motivation.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `For some reason, you are not honest with yourself. Perhaps you are sacrificing your life for no good reason. You can live on the desires of others and you deny the need and value within you. Are you playing the role of a martyr in a relationship? Such behavior can only lead to feelings of hopelessness and reluctance to associate with a worthwhile goal. You may not be willing to sacrifice for the better.

Are you afraid of making people around you saddened for acting differently or unlike others? Remember Emerson’s statement that a stupid insistence is the scary thing of a narrow mindset. You can search the whole world for enlightenment and do not waste your energy on useless projects. If you ask about a financial issue, be careful about investing in the wrong place or consider whether you are pursuing a dubious financial path at this time or not.

On the positive side, periods of stagnation may come to an end. If you are able to re-establish your priorities and find a way back in life, you are ready to act decisively.`,

    uprightFullDescription: `This is a Major card numbered 13, the number related to death since the use of the lunar calendar in which the 13th month is the time of death and resurrection. A big change and transition are about to happen. The Death Tarot card often appears when you are facing major life events such as marriage, divorce, leaving home, moving, changing jobs, parenting. A big change is coming in the structure of your life. A situation is about to end and a new era opens.

Now it is the time to give up the attitudes and circumstances that you have formed and built to move on to a new page of life. A loss may occur. All the useless and outdated things need to be eliminated. This is the time of the end and the time of the new beginning. As the New Testament had written, “Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains by itself”. You need to eliminate ineffective and outdated ways. Sometimes, this card literally refers to the death of someone you know.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `When the Death card appears in reverse, you are trying to hold a situation, relationship, or an outdated view that really needs to be eliminated. Your fear of change ties you to the past and hinders your growth. What are you afraid of? Your resistance to the necessary change will make the experience more painful when things happen. It will be better to face the problem courageously and adjustably rather than to go through the changes involuntarily.`,

    uprightFullDescription: `You feel trapped in an oppressive situation that may be created by you. Perhaps, you are feeling overwhelmed by those commitments which are full of responsibility. Do you refuse to put an end to a troubled relationship? Are you feeling hard to let it go when you know you should do it? When the Devil Tarot card appears in a spread, you need to consider your dependence on material possessions, insatiable passion, harmful relationships, and financial security. Your fear and negative thoughts are hindering your life.

Take a look at reality. How did you become a slave in your own life? Have you fallen into a network of unhealthy relationships? Are you greedy and afraid of losing material wealth? Are you using the money to trade love? Do you maintain a relationship that you know is harmful? Does material success tempt you? Are you obsessed with wealth or love affairs? Are drugs, alcohol, or other desirable things controlling your life?

The Devil Tarot warns you of using your power or influence to enslave or control others. You are trapped in a cramped scene that you have created yourself and it’s time to face your fear and inhibition. Your desperation and your beliefs that you can not change are restraining your growth. Why do you believe that your destiny is endured? Face the Dark Side (Shadow) to allow yourself to continue to grow. (according to psychologist Carl Gustav Jung’s theory of Shadow, It deals with the dark side of our fear, our own discomfort, and most of the difficult aspects of our characters that we must confront and accept before embracing ourselves.).`,

    reverseFullDescription: `On the positive side, the Devil Tarot card shows that you were out of shackles. You face the wrong values and the limits that you self-imposed. You are no longer dominated by your obsessions. A heavy bond is coming to an end. You are now ready to be free and independent, no longer in bad relationships, no longer yearning for money and power or thinking negatively. You are ready to break the oppression.

On the negative side, the Devil Tarot implies that you may act like you are the center of attention or in a greedy way. You may have to choose between money and happiness. Your physical desire or power can become an obsession. Most likely someone is controlling or enticing you. At present, you are prone to depression if you do not remove the knot that is tying you up. Many things that hold you back are caused by you and you are ready to face them. The negative meaning of the reversed Devil card warns about involvement in sexual misconduct. You feel hopeless when stuck in a situation that you can not bear its burden.`,

The normal structure in your life begins to crumble and you have to deal with the collapse of an outdated lifestyle. You can immediately sell a house, move to a new home, change jobs, pursue a new career, step into psychotherapy or especially change a relationship. Such changes help you understand yourself and take appropriate actions.

The fluctuations associated with the Tower Tarot card refer to a time when it is necessary to deal with the reality that forces you to escape from the fake life and identify things that are truly worthy. The more you try to live in that life, the more intense the change is.

Now it is the time to free yourself from the social constraints and false beliefs that hinder your development. The mechanisms of confinement must be broken before you can enlighten. Sometimes, this card predicts theft, losing a job, family quarrels, or property troubles. The old order must be torn down making room for the new one. Bad structures will collapse.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `On the positive side, this card refers to the shocking or disruptive effects which are about to come to an end. Now you can overcome the financial or emotional damage and start a new beginning.

You feel constrained, hindered, restricted. Imprisonment, in reality, is rarely likely to occur. You feel trapped in a negative situation without a way out. Now you have to face the trouble that could have been avoided. You suffer the consequences of mistakes in the past.

The Tower Tarot card in reverse may also reduce the level or the impact of a change that is about to enter your life. You may be warned in advance or you may have an intuitive feeling that something big is going to happen, and you can prepare a plan for avoiding this destruction. You may be fortunate enough to prevent this disaster even though it will be quite hard.`,

This is the end of a cycle, a moment of innovation and awakening, and it is time to reap the results of previous actions. It is time to get rid of your past mistakes and prepare for a positive start. At this point, you can see everything is clearer.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `Generally, the Judgement reversed implies that now you are facing the consequences of a wrong decision you had made in the past. In addition, you may also be avoiding an important decision because you are afraid of the changes which will happen in your life. Perhaps you have looked at the whole process of your life and now you realize it is worthless. Your relationship, job, situation, or the tight structure may have grown fast, but you don’t want to give them up.

Although you do not feel ready, you may need to put an end to some aspects of your life. Circumstances, illness or even death can separate you from a loved one. Perhaps work or career problems have created a gap between you and an important person. A relationship may come to an end and you may not want to end it. You can not delay facing the truth forever. Despite the fact that it may seem difficult, you have to let go of the past to continue your life.

Major unwanted changes can get out of control. A legal decision or test result may not be in your favor. Sometimes the reversed Judgment card refers to health problems, especially problems with vision and hearing.

If you ask about the results of a medical examination, be prepared for the bad news. With the question of relationship, the reversed Judgment may indicate separation or divorce. If you ask about a legal matter, reversed Judgment shows the result would not be good for you (especially if there is the reversed Six of Wands in a spread, indicating the obstacles caused by betrayal and deception).
The Judgement in reverse recommends you to pay attention to bad karma and learn from your past mistakes. You may need to ignore the loss and continue to live in a more constructive way.`,

This is also a perfect time to paint up your imagination and realize your real dreams. But remember, this Ace and other Ace cards are just seeds that have not grown yet. You have a chance with many promises but that only happens when you take advantage of all of your abilities to develop it.

The Ace of Wands also expressed a state of anxiety, uncertainty about the method of conduct. You can have energy and passion but have not got a specific direction. All the great ideas are beginning to form in your mind and ready to explode at any time, but you need to find the best way to take advantage of that huge energy.

You can start or open a business and will spend the energy of your business building new foundations and starting promises. Things happen that motivate your career path. This is the time to initiate, invent and create.

This card encourages you to listen instinctively and follow your own path. If it is a good idea, it will be fine. So, let’s start with a few basic things first and continue to develop your ideas through more complex plans later on. It is important to take action now, do not spend too much time planning or researching.`,

Those promises in which you trust may be the same as well. You may feel disillusioned, helpless and unable to reach the goal. Your persistence or selfish attitude can be the cause of your troubles.

This reversed card shows that you are having difficulty clearly defining what you want. You lack direction and the energy gradually becomes exhausted, making you feel very tedious and lose motivation. As a result, you often wonder if this is what you really want and whether there is something better that you have not discovered yet. When thinking about other opportunities, your beliefs begin to shake. To overcome this, you first need to focus on your true passion. Without motivation and passion, you will not be able to succeed. So, you should take some time to ponder what you really want.

It may also point out that you are burdened by responsibility and commitment, so you can not pursue new ideas that you have. If there is a Ten of Wands card, it means you are trying to free yourself from the heavy responsibility to pursue a new passion. In addition, you can give up the regular habit for new ideas to grow.

This Ace card may indicate delay or frustration when the progress of the project and the idea is not what you expected. You will feel very impatient at this point, especially if you appreciate the plan which is already set but just started to do. Besides, you might also have a great idea, but you have not found a certain way to do it. Again, you are becoming impatient when you can only present but not make that idea come true. Time is of the essence, so be patient and wait for the best opportunity.`,

You are in the early stages of setting up a business and feel like it is not easy to make progress. Most things are not very enthusiastic. The main opportunity is when you are considering a project, a trip, an activity with a partner. You may be anticipating a response to a business proposal/a job or application.

You have the ability to overcome obstacles. You just need to control your creative energy and plan carefully to pursue your goals.

You succeeded by working hard. You will achieve the goal if you follow the plan outlined. You can move to a new home or business location and may also receive job-related bonuses.

Discontent or the thinking that you are useless can lead to controversy with a companion or termination of a partnership. If you are contemplating a joint venture with another person, this card reminds you to consider the issue with caution.

This card also shows you need to start organizing long-term goals and prioritizing what is important to you as well as what you really want to achieve. At this point, you may want too many things but you know for sure that you can not achieve all. So, again, you should think about what is important to you and what motivates you, leading you on the road ahead. Let’s focus on your passion and start planning for those goals.

You may be afraid to set foot in a completely unknown place although the potential is huge. The problem is that your development is being held in the current environment and that the world has become too small for you. It is time to pay attention to your original goals and understand the benefits of risk taking and entering a bigger world.

This reversed card can also indicate that you have missed some important details related to your plan. Maybe things are going well then there are some problems that happen unexpectedly. Or, you are too confident about your success and forget the most important things. Or, you can lose your passion and become easily depressed and lose interest. It is important to rekindle that passion or start over with something which is more inspirational.`,

You may also be having trouble implementing your plan and feel anxious because things seem to be getting overwhelming for you. You lack foresight and can not detect troubles as soon as they arise or you are unrealistic about the risks involved in your plan.

Thus, you should find a place where there is competition and respect your opponent but stand on your own. Let’s fight against the tendency toward frustration, anger, hatred and prejudice.

There may also be problems and legal issues. You may need to face offensive things and trivial troubles. You participate in a contest which is expected. If you ask about love, you may need to compete with someone to win over the heart of your lover. If you ask about travel, then maybe your plan will be delayed or there is some trouble.

Sometimes, conflicts and discussions can be very positive, such as the whole team thinking together to solve the problem.

So, you deflect a lot of energy and ignore the problem, if any. However, the trouble is that while doing this, you just remove some bothers aside, without actually tackling them. Some conflicts can be good, especially if they are constructive and point out the basics to find a better solution.

If a particular project is not as successful as expected, it is better to move to a new environment that can rebuild personal credibility and branding, rather than trying to fix it.

This reversed card shows that you have tried to achieve too many things at the same time and can not do all well like this commitment. It may be best to focus on just a few things and make them go smoothly. This will help you feel inspired and keep up the activities you commit.
It may reflect the temporary nature of success. At some point, you are at the top of the world because you have achieved great things, but then the expectations you get become too high, and when you make mistakes, you will be kicked to the ground and take all the blame. When you win and feel great, never fall asleep and keep trying until everyone recognizes you instead.`,

    uprightFullDescription: `The Four of Cups often appears when you are bored or dissatisfied with the present situation. You may have withdrawn yourself because of dissatisfaction with some aspects of life. You have a feeling of depression or shortfalls. Everything seems boring and unsatisfactory. The disadvantage in this situation is that you do not see the good things around and can refuse the recommended help. To overcome this, this Cups card suggests that you need to re-evaluate the situation and look deeply into your own soul to find out the meaning of life. You should stay focused and stay away from distractions to find out the truth you want.

It is time to wake up, stay alert and open up to new experiences to achieve a more positive result. 

The Four of Cups sometimes speaks of defensiveness. This can be seen through the body language displayed in the posture of sitting cross-legged and folding arms of the man in the card. He chooses to ignore the potential of the available cups. Maybe he had been hurt emotionally, because this is the Cups, and he was afraid of failure again, so he closed his heart to this opportunity. You should consider the opportunities that you are ignoring, and ask yourself whether this really does not work for you or you are scared, do not dare to take it. And be careful when you decide to close your heart to something.

The worst meaning of this Cup card is the ungrateful and stubborn person. Whether you are hiding in your own little world, depressed, selfish, or nurturing a wound from a previously broken relationship, the causes of isolation are that you are self-imposed. You only care about your own troubles and problems and that you ignore the needs of others. Be awake, and remember, there is always a chance for you to connect with the world around you.

Usually, this card implies that a recommendation has been made for you but that you are delaying making a decision or finding out about the opportunity. It should be noted that, although not accepting the offer being presented to him, the man in the card did not completely deny it. The cups will still be there and await his decision at any time. Now, it is time to ponder, research and meditate, so you do not have to rush to make any decision.`,

On the negative side, the Four of Cups in reverse indicates that you may experience a significant period of stagnation. Do not let your self-esteem control you.`,

    uprightFullDescription: `You may feel stuck or confused when making a decision. The options seem too much or too even, or each option can have several different types of trade-offs. You can not have everything and you are not sure which way to go. Your heart urges you to go in one direction and your mind tells you to go to another one. You need to concentrate and focus on a single target for success. At this point, your dream is your worst enemy.

Your success will depend on careful consideration of the issues. The Seven of Cups warns that your thoughts may be too messy to make the best choice.

On the other hand, this is a great time for any kind of creative project. Sometimes, this card can foretell a meaningful dream or spiritual intuition. If so, remember to listen to your inner voice.

It is also a card of desire. Each cup contains the desire of wealth, beauty, success, and a nice house (castle or tower). However, not all glasses have a positive effect. Two cups contain a snake and a demon so that the Seven of Cups can be a mixed blessing. Be careful what you wish for because you can only get it at a price.

The temptation goes along with the Seven of Cups. With so many choices displayed in front of you, you are easily affected by the cup of the jealous and cunning snake.

Your first attempt to achieve a goal may have failed because you have not focused wisely or did not have enough concentration.
You can now see mistakes in the past and the wrong start of those previous efforts; this allows you to set clearer action to achieve your goals. Besides, you have overcome your confusion and have a more realistic attitude. However, you need to put the problem into context and have a clear view of the reality of the situation. Now you can think clearly about the options and come up with a sensible and wise decision. Finally, you should focus on the essential and perseverance to pursue your good ideas.

On a more positive note, this reversed Cups card says that you can finally eradicate the fog of confusion and illusion, and focus on the goal you chose as well as find out the best way to solve the problem.`,

Sometimes, a journey will reduce stress and restore balance and harmony. You may have the opportunity to travel or you may greet a guest from a far distance.

You are now ready to enlighten new things. This is the time to look back on the difficulties in the past to ensure a better future. An event or someone close to you can make you feel relieved. Now you can leave behind pessimistic actions or situations.`,

You may have followed an inadequate solution to your problem. Perhaps you chose the easiest way (not the best way) or simply you are avoiding reality.

    uprightFullDescription: `You may feel cheated or upset about what you have done. You may want to escape or run away, but you need to avoid those actions that bring you failure. Do not become your own worst enemy. You must become skillful and clever to deal with your opponents and achieve your goals. Other people may be trying to deceive you or may damage your reputation. They can take advantage of the fact that your mind is fulfilled with other issues or you can attack when the opponent loses focus.

Your unique worldview and the ability to do unexpected things can save you in emergencies. A plan you have outlined may not happen as expected. Perhaps you will need advice from a specialist or legal counsel. This card may refer to involvement in deceptive, deceptive, illegal, or sneaky activities.

Sometimes, Seven of Swords refers to a robbery which happens in reality (especially there is another card referring to “deception” – like the Moon – appears during a spreading), but most likely, the damage happens to you from some form of speech or communication. You should be especially careful about what you say or write at this time. An intellectual battle may be imminent. Someone can be against the independence and freedom of your wisdom. This card may also refer to the forward-looking progress and the abandonment of some aspects of your life.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `Seven of Swords implies that if you have been robbed, the thief will not be able to keep the stolen item. If someone has done something wrong to you, wait for an apology. You should appreciate any criticism you receive at this time because it is more likely to be constructive. If something has been taken from you unfairly, it may return right now.

Someone can give you useful help or advice. This is the time to be wise if you want to succeed. An approach that is too casual or unimaginative will not help you at all.`,

    reverseKeywords: 'self-acceptance, new perspective, freedom',

    uprightFullDescription: `Anyone who has seen the existential play “No Exit” in 1994 will understand what this card is about. The Eight of Swords represents fear, siege, limits, and restrictions which are often self-imposed. You feel confined, trapped and unable to escape.

You can act as your own worst enemy due to fear of unformed things and reluctance to try something new or to assert yourself. You are trapped in the swamp created by yourself. Your ability to communicate may be temporarily reduced. You may fall into a difficult situation that seems to have no way out. You feel imprisoned and restricted by circumstances while the cause of major limitations is the refusal to accept your own reality.

You have to face your own fear before making any important decision. With your courage, you can overcome your worries and solve problems around you. If you cannot see things clearly, this is the time to seek and follow the wise advice. Sometimes, the limitations that the Eight of Swords denote are the result of an accident or a death that brings the following restrictions.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `Now you can break the restrictions and confront your fears and worries. The pressure you face is beginning to decline. You can be more aware of what is around you and deal with the factors that interfere with your progress. After conquering your fears, you are completely free to start over again. Obstacles have been removed and the freedom of movement has been established. It is the right time to become assertive and reject the restrictions that others impose on you.`,

    uprightFullDescription: `The Nine of Swords is a nightmare card. Your sleep can be disturbed when you cope with anxiety. The act of hatred of someone causes you pain. You may be exhausted from fear, guilt, doubt, and anxiety at an unfounded level. You are too sensitive to the criticism and insults of others. The difficulties that you imagine may not be so gloomy once they are clarified.

It is possible that you are facing a troublesome situation or a difficult decision, but your worst fear is less likely to come true. The misery that you are suffering as a consequence of the previous difficult circumstances. Sometimes, this card is literally about a woman close to you who is suffering from physical or mental pain and needs your help.`,

    reverseFullDescription: `On the positive side, the reversed Nine of Swords implies that the nightmare is over. You may still suffer the consequences of difficult situations, but the pain is almost over. But your fantasies seem much worse than reality. It does not help at all if you keep worrying about unfounded things. You let negative thoughts and restlessness control your mind. It is a card of hope, a hint of faith in the future and a promise of more beautiful days ahead.

On the negative side, it simply reaffirms the meaning of the rest of the spread. Your grief lasts for quite a long time. You are always obsessed with unhealthy and desperate worries. You are going through a long period of pain and despair. However, this reversed card usually has a hopeful meaning.`,

    uprightFullDescription: `You are going down. Your plans were not successful. You have reached the outside limit. A situation or relationship that is coming to an end and cannot be changed makes you feel like standing on the threshold of depression because of the loss. You have done all the things you can and now it is the time you need to make a definite change or you must endure the consequences. This ending occurs at the same time as the feeling of loss and deep sadness. You may be feeling about ending a relationship.
The change is imposed on you and you cannot fight for yourself in this situation. Loss can be related to legal or professional issues, a serious illness or separation from important people in your life. Do you feel so depressed that you need assistance in terms of expertise? An event has passed that may still worry you. You cannot do anything to save the past. Remember that Sorin Cerin once said, “The dawn of beauty always comes after night”.

You need to let go of the declining situation or false beliefs to open the way to the future. Like the Tower card of the Major set, the Ten of Swords can mean a clear perception and dispelling false beliefs. Sometimes, this card hints of movement (particularly by the waterway) which is related to separation.`,

Valuable things that will come from your recent pain. The improvement is still ahead. You or your loved one have the ability to overcome a dangerous situation. One of the meanings of Ten of Swords is “touch the bottom”. When we see it in a spread, the disaster has finally happened and what you can expect right now is that the situation will become better.`,
